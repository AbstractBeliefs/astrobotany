This project is currently in beta. Feel free to stay and enjoy, but tread carefully!

Welcome to astrobotany. You've been given a seed that will grow into a beautiful plant. Check in and water your plant every 24h to keep it growing. 5 days without water = death. Your plant depends on you and your friends to live!

“Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.” ― Robert Louis Stevenson
