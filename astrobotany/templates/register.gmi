# Astrobotany - Registration

Welcome!

Astrobotany uses self-signed (TOFU) client certificates for authentication.

Here are some known gemini clients with support for client certificates.

=>https://github.com/pitr/gemini-ios Gemini for iOS

In order to join in the fun, use your preferred gemini client to generate a new client certificate. All certificate fields can be left blank *except* for the subject CN (Common Name). This value will be your public username inside of astrobotany. Pick something unique and memorable!

Access the following endpoint with your certificate to register your account:
=>/register/submit

Once your account has been created, you can go here to login:
=>/app
